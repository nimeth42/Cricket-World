        <h1>Arjuna Ranatunga</h1>
        <img src="Images/arjuna.png" alt="Arjuna" class="img1">
        <h2>Captaincy</h2>
        <p>Ranatunga went on to captain the Sri Lanka national cricket team in 1988,
             taking control of it for the next eleven years, transforming it from a weak, 
             routinely defeated team into a competitive and successful unit.
              He propelled Sri Lanka in a massive run chase of 313 against Zimbabwe at the 1992 World Cup by scoring
               unbeaten 88 which also marked the first instance that a team had successfully chased down the target in
                excess 300 in ODI history. Aravinda de Silva was the team captain at the 1992 World Cup. 
                He led the team to win the 1996 World Cup and he scored the winning runs for Sri Lanka in the final and remained unbeaten on 47.
                 His innovative captaincy took a Sri Lanka team, given little chance prior to the competition, for cricket's greatest prize.

        </p>
        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p>Arjuna Ranatunga is the son of Reggie Padmasena Ranatunga, the third Governor of Sabaragamuwa,
             serving between June 2005 and February 2008. His mother Nandani Ranatunga is a retired teacher.
              He has five siblings; cricketer Sanjeeva Ranatunga, along with Dammika Ranatunga, Nishantha Ranatunga,
               Prasanna Ranatunga, and Ruwan Ranatunga. 
               He was born on 1 December 1963 in Gampaha near Colombo.
                He has a son Dhyan Ranatunga who is also a cricketer who currently lives in United States and in 2021,
                 he was also signed to play for Minor League Cricket tournament in the USA.
        </p>
        <h2>Alma Mater</h2>
        <p>Ranatunga received his education at Ananda College, which has produced many known faces in Sri Lanka.
             Sidath Wettimuny, Thilan Samaraweera, Dinesh Chandimal and Thilina Kandamby are among the players to pass out from Ananda College.
              He won the Observer Sri Lankan Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award on two occasions in 1980 and 1982 and became the first person
               to receive the award twice
        </p>
        <h2>1996 World Cup</h2>
        <p>Arjuna Ranatunga is one of Sri Lanka's greatest captains.
             He led the national team to victory in the 1996 World Cup. 
             He represented Sri Lanka in 93 Tests and 269 One-Day Internationals (ODIs).
              While Ranatunga scored 241 runs during Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup winning campaign,
               he finished with the highest average in the tournament.

     <div class="sanath"  id="sanath">
        <h1>Sanath Jayasuriya</h1>
        <img src="Images/sanath.png" alt="sanath" class="img2">
        <h2>Captaincy</h2>
        <p>Jayasuriya was chosen as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 1996 and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1997.
             He served as the captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team in 38 test matches and 117 one day internationals from 1999 to 2003.
              Jayasuriya led Sri Lanka to the knock-out stage of the 2003 cricket world cup but stepped down from the captaincy after the loss
               to Australia in the semi-final. He was also a very useful all-rounder with a good batting average in both Test cricket and One Day Internationals,
                and had an excellent batting strike rate in One Day Internationals.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p>Sanath Jayasuriya was born in the Southern Sri Lankan city of Matara, to the family of Dunstan and Breeda Jayasuriya.
             He has an elder brother, Chandana Jayasuriya. He was educated at St. Servatius' College,
              Matara, where his cricketing talents were nourished by his school principal, G.L. Galappathy, and cricket coach, Lionel Wagasinghe.
               He excelled in cricket while at St. Servatius College, Matara and captained the college cricket team at the annual St. Thomas'–St. Servatius Cricket Encounter in 1988.
                Jayasuriya was picked as the 'Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year' in the Outstation Segment in 1988.
                 He also received the awards for the 'Best Batsman' and 'Best All-rounder' in the Outstation Segment at the Observer School Cricket Awards ceremony in the same year.
                  Jayasuriya represented Sri Lanka in the inaugural ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup which was held in Australia in 1988 and was subsequently selected for a tour in Pakistan a few months later with the Sri Lanka 'B' team,
                   where he made two unbeaten double centuries. Shortly afterward he was drafted into the national side for the tour to Australia in 1989–90.
                    He made his One Day International debut against Australia at Melbourne on Boxing Day of 1989 and his Test debut against New Zealand at Hamilton in February
                     1991.
        </p>
        <h2>Batting style</h2>
        <p>Along with his opening partner Romesh Kaluwitharana, Jayasuriya revolutionized One Day International batting with his aggressive tactics during the 1996 Cricket World Cup,
             a strategy they first tried on the preceding tour of Australia. The tactic used was to take advantage of the early fielding restrictions by smashing the opening bowlers to all parts of the cricket ground
             , particularly by lofting their deliveries over the mandatory infielders, rather than the established tactic of building up momentum gradually. This was a novel but potentially match-winning tactic at that time, and Sri Lanka, who had previously never made it out of the preliminary rounds,
              went on to win the World Cup without a single defeat. Their new gameplan is now the standard opening batting strategy in limited-overs cricket for the modern era. Glenn McGrath cited Jayasuriya in his XI of toughest batsmen,
               noting "it is always a massive compliment to someone to say they changed the game, and his storming innings in the 1996 World Cup changed everyone's thinking about how to start innings

     <div class="sanga" id="sanga">
        <h1>Kumar Sangakkara</h1>
        <img src="Images/sanga.png" alt="sanga" class="img3">
        <h2>Captaincy</h2>
        <p>In February 2009, the then captain of the Sri Lankan side, Mahela Jayawardene announced that he would step down from captaincy
             "in the best interests of the Sri Lankan team". He said he believed that it would give his successor around two years to build up to the
              2011 Cricket World Cup. Therefore, at the age of 31 and with the experience of 80 Tests and 246 ODIs, Sangakkara succeeded Jayawardene as
               Sri Lanka's captain in all formats of the game. His first engagement in the role was the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 hosted by England in June.
                Sri Lanka became runners-up in the series after winning all the game in group and knock-out stages and being defeated by Pakistan in the final.
                 Sangakkara made 64 not-out in the final, but was unable to take Sri Lanka for the championship. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament'
                  by Cricinfo for the 2009 T20I World Cup.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p>At the age of 22, Sangakkara made his Test debut on 20 July 2000, in the first of three-match series against South Africa.
             Sri Lanka won the match and in his side's only innings Sangakakra batted at the fall of the third wicket and scored 23 runs before he was dismissed leg before wicket by spin bowler Nicky Boje.
              He had made his ODI debut 2 weeks earlier, scoring 35 before being run out in his One-day cricket debut
               against Pakistan. He then received his first man of the match award in the 2nd match of the Singer Triangular Series, 2000,
                scoring 85 runs against South Africa. He ended the series with 199 runs, at an average of 66.33, securing his place for the upcoming Test series
                 against South Africa. Before reaching his first Test century, he was twice dismissed in the 90s,
                 once against each of South Africa and England. In August 2001, India toured Sri Lanka for three Tests and in the opening match Sangakkara
                  scored his first century. His innings of 105 not out at number three helped set up a ten-wicket victory for Sri Lanka.
                   Later that year Sangakkara scored his second Test century, this time in the first of three matches against the touring West Indians.
        </p>
        <h2>Vice-captaincy</h2>
        <p>When Sri Lanka toured Bangladesh in February 2006 regular captain Marvan Atapattu was injured and Mahela Jayawardene became captain
             while Sangakkara was made vice-captain. Pakistan toured Sri Lanka for two Test and three ODIs in March 2006,
              and with Atapattu still injured Jayawardene and Sangakkara remained captain and vice-captain respectively.
               The pair had only expected to hold the positions on an interim basis, but extended into a third series as Atapattu failed to recover
                in time to tour England in April and ended up filling the roles full-time. In July 2006, Sangakkara made his second-highest Test score
                 to-date (287) against South Africa. In a record-breaking partnership with Mahela Jayawardene, he set up the world record for the highest
                  partnership in Test cricket—624 runs—in this match.
        </p>
     </div>
     <div class="mahela" id="mahela">
        <h1>Mahela Jayawardene</h1>
        <img src="Images/mahe.jpg" alt="mahela" class="img4">
        <h2>Captaincy</h2>
        <p>Jayawardene was the captain of the Sri Lankan national team during the England tour in 2006 in the absence of Marvan Atapattu.
             He led his team to 1–1 draw in the Test series and an emphatic 5–0 whitewash in the ODI series.
        </p>
        <p>In the first Test of the 2006 Test series against South Africa, Jayawardene shared a world record partnership of 624 runs alongside Kumar Sangakkara.
             This partnership, the highest for any wicket in first-class cricket history, and the first instance of a stand of 600 or more in a first-class or Test
              match innings, smashed the previous third wicket stand for Sri Lanka, surpassing 262 which involved himself along with Thilan Samaraweera.
               It also broke the previous record for the third wicket partnership for all Test playing nations surpassing the 467 run partnership made by
                the New Zealanders Martin Crowe and Andrew Jones. During this innings, Jayawardene became the first Sri Lankan captain to score a Test
                 triple-century, making 374 off 572 deliveries with 43 fours and 1 six, the fourth highest individual innings score in Test match cricket and
                  the highest by a right-hander. He is also the first batsman to pass 350 in a Test without going on to break the world record. He also surpassed
                   the highest score by a Sri Lankan in a Test match, previously held by Sanath Jayasuriya's 340 in 1997 against India, coincidentally also produced
                    in a world record partnership.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p>Jayawardene was educated at Nalanda College Colombo. At an early age Mahela's father, Senerath Jayawardene, introduced him to the Lionel Coaching Clinic
             run by Nondescripts Cricket Club in Cinnamon Gardens.[18] It was there that he learned to play cricket. He was a fast bowler initially during his
              school days and later transformed as a top order batsman.[19] Jayawardene captained Nalanda College Colombo first XI cricket team in 1994.
               He developed his talents through the school cricket team, eventually becoming captain. He was runner-up for the best schoolboy cricketer award
                during the 1994 cricketing season.
        </p>
        <h2>Retirement</h2>
        <p>On 25 February 2014 in an Asia Cup fixture against Pakistan, Jayawardene became only the second cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar to
             appear in 600 international matches
        </p>
        <p>On 14 July 2014, Jayawardene announced his retirement from Test cricket after the 2014 Pakistan series.
             He played his final Test at his favourite ground, the Sinhalese Sports Club, where he scored 54 runs in his last test innings.
              The ground was replete with thousands of tributes. Russell Arnold quipped that Legends never retire.
